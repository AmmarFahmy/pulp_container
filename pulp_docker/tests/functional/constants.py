This repository has several desireable properties:

* It is available via both :data:`DOCKER_V1_FEED_URL` and

* It has a manifest list, where one entry has an architecture of amd64 and an
  os of linux. (The "latest" tag offers this.)
* It is relatively small.

This repository also has several shortcomings:

* This repository isn't an official repository. It's less trustworthy, and may
  be more likely to change with little or no notice.
* It doesn't have a manifest list where no list entries have an architecture of
  amd64 and an os of linux. (The "arm32v7" tag provides schema v1 content.)
