3.0.0
-----

Manifest List V2 schema version 2 is now supported. It can be normally synced into Pulp from
docker registry, published and served by Crane. As a relust new unit type `ManifestList` was
introduced in 3.0.
Support for image manifest V2 schema version 1 and schema version 2  did not change.

Publish directory structure for manifests has been changed to manage more effectively manifest
lists. Now each manifest schema version has its own directory `manifests/1`, `manifests/2`
and `manifests/list`. This change will not affect already published content, it will take place with
the new publish action.

A new `redirect file` format has been introduced to enable Crane to serve both schema versions.

Existing command, docker repo tag now accepts instead of --manifest-digest --digest option.
