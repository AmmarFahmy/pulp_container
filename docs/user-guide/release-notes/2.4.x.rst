2.4 Release Notes
=================

2.4.0
-----

Manifest V2 schema version 2 is now supported. It can be normally synced into Pulp from
docker registry, published and served by Crane.
Support for manifest V2 schema version 1 did not change.

Publish directory structure for manifests has been changed to manage more effectively manifest
schema versions. Now each manifest schema version has its own directory `manifests/1` and
`manifests/2`. This change will not affect already published content, it will take place with
the new publish action.

A new `redirect file` format has been introduced to enable Crane to serve both schema versions.


2.4.1
-----

New parameter for rsync distributor ``rsync_extra_args`` allows user to specify custom arguments
for rsync call during publish operations.
